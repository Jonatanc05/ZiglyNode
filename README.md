## ZiglyNode - Zig Lyght Node

#### A Bitcoin light client with minimal dependencies written in Zig

- I like [handmade software](https://handmade.network/)
- I like [Bitcoin](https://btcmaxis.com/)
- I like [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

## Build Requirements

- Currently building with Zig 0.14.1
    - See https://ziglang.org/download/

- Windows 11 and Ubuntu WSL are usually tested.

- Before compiling, add a file called `.privkey` to the `src` directory.
    - `echo 0a1a2a3a4a0a1a2a3a4a0a1a2a3a4a0a1a2a3a4a0a1a2a3a4a0a1a2a3a4a0a1a > src/.privkey`

This file should contain hex characters representing the private key to use when signing transactions. **DO NOT USE REAL WALLET INFORMATION WITH THIS SOFTWARE**.

## Features

All features here are implemented (at least almost) from scratch. Using only the standard library and an external RIPEMD hash function.

- Amateur cryptography (ECDSA)
- Bitcoin primitives (Address, Transaction, Block) with serialization
- Signing valid transactions (see https://mempool.space/signet/tx/d5cf8e758abc178121736c9cbb0defe075ef50da4dfb4e736b19f2a2ff66dd14)
- Basic Script interpreter (tested P2PK, P2PKH and P2WPKH)
- Ability to communicate with the Bitcoin network
    - Handshake with other peers
    - Get block headers, check they are valid and write/load them on disk
    - Get neighbour peers to discover the network
- Multi-threaded handshakes for speed

## TODO

- [ ] Networking improvements
  - [x] Concurrent connect calls
  - [ ] Consume next address immediately after a connection fails
  - [ ] Event loop to answer spontaneous messages (not sure we need this)
- [ ] Continous requests (enter synchronization mode)
- [ ] P2SH
- [ ] Check difficulty when receiving block headers
- [ ] SPV
- [ ] SegWit

Issues:
- [ ] We can't seem to receive blocks from `/Satoshi:25.1.0/`
  - Minimum version we know that works is `/Satoshi:27.0.0/`
